				The CSS is almost the same as that of the scrollbar track’s, but here there is no “height: 100%”,
				since the height will vary depending on how much content there is on the page. The scrollbar also has 
				a width of 10px, is attached to the right side of the viewport, and is given some mild styling.
				Keep in mind that you won’t be able to see these styles yet, as the elements haven’t actually been created by the 
				javascript yet.
